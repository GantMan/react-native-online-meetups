## Speakers

### Leland Richardson

#### Bio
Work on React Native @ Airbnb

#### Outline
I can talk about our navigation library, as well as anything else that we are doing at Airbnb that 
people are interested in, for example some of the responses to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/788249703737458689).

### Sonny Lazuardi

#### Bio
Work on React Native @ Sale Stock

#### Outline
I can talk about code sharing between our android app and web app using React Native Web. I can also talk about versioner (like codepush) and how we do automatic update for our react native android app.

### Alexey Kureev

#### Bio
React Native ronin @ OSS

#### Outline
I can talk about JS - Native bridge. For instance, I can explain what actually happens once you call `AppRegistry.registerComponent` and how your React tree maps to the real native UI you see on a device.

### Truls Skeie

#### Bio
Work at Routes.guide and as a Consultant. 

#### Outline
At Routes.guide we have a webapp, and a RN (React-native) ios and Android app. I can talk about code sharing between the webapp and the native apps.
I can also talk about the challenges of using RN to develop for both Android and iOS.

As a consultant I’ve been working on a calling app (app-to-app and app-to-[PSTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network]).
This is just for Android. For this project we have written a couple of native modules for Android I can possible talk about that. We have also written a little bit of the UI in plain Java / Android (XML). So I can talk about how we share data between this (even though I don’t think we have solved it elegantly I would love to get some feedback and tell why we did what we did).

I've worked with RN for the past 1.5 years and I had zero experience in developing native Android and iOS apps before RN.

### Preethi Kasireddy

Work on React @ Coinbase and React Native for side projects/OSS
