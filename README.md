React Native Online Meetups
===

So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native.

### How I see it:

1. We get speakers, around 4-5 speakers per meetup
2. The session will last around an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. To be a speaker on a next meetup just send a PR to `nextMeetup.md` with your short bio and a very short outline of what you'd like to talk about.
5. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
6. More to follow, stay tuned!
